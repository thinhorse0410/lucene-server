<h1>Lucene Server</h1>
A basic example JSON/HTTP server showing how to use Lucene's APIs in a server context.
<p>
    Features/design:
<ul>
    <li> A number of Lucene's capabilities have been exposed:
        indexing documents, bulk indexing (streaming JSON), block
        joins, grouping, highlighting, suggest, live-values,
        snapshots, etc.

    <li> Lucene's legacy FieldCache is never used; only the
        faster, more RAM efficient doc values are used when you
        sort, group, facet on a field.

    <li> All searching is based on near-real-time IndexReader; you
        configure the minimum and maximum refresh times.

    <li> There is no required ID field; instead, a document is
        identified by the pair of the searcher version and Lucene's
        docID.

    <li> The server APIs are self documenting; point your browser
        at http://localhost:4000/doc to browse the available methods
        and parameters.

    <li> Error checking is strict but each error message should
        be easy to understand, pointing to the exact path/parameter
        that was problematic. It's an error if a
        request has unexpected parameters.

    <li> Write-once schema: fields must be registered up front,
        once, before any document is indexed with them; once a field
        is registered, it cannot be changed (write-once).

    <li> All changes (creating and configuring indices, indexing
        documents, etc.) are done through JSON APIs; there are no
        human-edited configuration files (though the server does
        store its index metadata in on-disk JSON files).

    <li> A snapshot records all configuration (registered fields,
        settings, etc.) in addition to the point-in-time view of the
        index; future searches can then reference that snapshot for
        searching.

    <li> A server thread pool handles all concurrency during
        indexing, so a single client thread using the bulk
        indexing API will take advantage of the server computer's
        concurrent hardware.

    <li> Settings are divided into <em>live</em> settings, which
        can be changed after the index is started, and ordinary
        settings, which cannot.

    <li> Limited infrastructure for plugins.
</ul>
