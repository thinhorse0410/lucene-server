use renderedFields instead?  this translates jira markup to HTML

hmm is point-in-time searcher version not working!

better handling of renamed issues

are we getting dup suggestions w/ rename?

org.this.that is not splitting into tokens!!

lucene smoke doesn't highlight lucene in suggestions?

remove isDev/prod/isMike?

NRT is failing to show new comments?

grep through production logs for exeptions!

why does "bens" make bogus suggestions?

search for 7462 SHOULD have found LUCENE-7174, like it does in production now

how come number search e.g. 7462 does not highlight the issue title?

annoyingly, the Jira query process does NOT count a new commit on an issue as updating its timestamp

is NRT indexer not seeing newly created issues?

merge the missed issues back into allIssues.txt in /lucenedata

is there a faster bulk export?
  - should i re-do w/ rendering and use html strip char factory to get good final inch highlighting somehow...
